Basically it takes any number of characters inside the second buffer

It saves the strcmp result after this buffer

So, I can calculate the offset of the strcmp result and enter suitable number of characters 

scanf puts a NULL TERMINATOR at the end of the buffer so I can enter number of charcters and NULL TERMINATOR instead of the strcmp result

BOOOM I GET GOODBOY MSG
