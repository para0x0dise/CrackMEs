This is a simple, but flawed program. It is impossible to give a legit password to this program and unlock this.

But, there is still might be a way. Look at the Assembly code and find out a way to bypass the check using any bugs in code, and print the success message. If you do, write a solution writeup and submit.


This is the first non-RE based crackme by me. Hope you enjoy it. This will be really easy.


The solution is included with the program. However, it is locked for now. I will upload the password in the crackmes page after a few days. If you couldn't find it, look at the solution file and figure out how it works.

Note: The solution_file contains no explanation. It just contains a possible solution. 

You are not supposed to "fix" the program by patching. There is a way to print the success message using this program itself.

This is an exploitation based crackme. You are supposed to exploit the crackme instead of finding valid solution. If you are not into that, or the mods doesn't allow it, feel free to ignore/remove it.
