Mission: PowerGrid


...your city has been without main power for 3 days now. It's critical for heat & light, as in the post-impact world the star which heated the surface is only barely visible. The reserve batteries are almost drained and the people will die if power is not restored, not only because of cold but having no light is extremely dangerous because of all the deadly beings lurking in dark. A group of 5 people including you came to the nuclear facility that powered the city. You found out that the ancient pre-impact facility is no longer producing any substantial amount of power at all. Your people try to find manuals and all but this thing is way too old and complex to repair. You, specialized at the pre-impact general purpose computing machines, use a terminal to find that something is wrong with the core itself. It is no longer producing any real power.

   You realize it can't be repaired and started investigating the outlands, desperately checking for anything that produce electric power in large amount. You find an enormous mysterious wall that's half broken situated between two mountains. To clear the doubt whether it's a secret facility or anything that generates power is on the other side, you people climb the mountain. Unsurprisingly, there's just a small lake of contaminated water on the other side of the wall. But you find a weird looking facility on the other mountain downrange. You people go there. The building is full of weird pipes and all, and there is strong foul smell of contaminated water everywhere, and it is even more cold than the outside. You find a control centre, and after some work, you managed to turn on a terminal. The manuals and other documents indicate that this facility is connected to the same grid and is capable of generating power...



Optional: ...you found something(__guide__optional.pdf) looks like a handwritten guide that you think can help you...
(Not recommended at first, experiment yourself with the terminal)


Mission: Turn on the power generators to bring the PowerGrid online.
